### Go Language (58:44 - 1:01:57)
The discussion shifts to the Go programming language, which the speaker had co-authored a book about. The language has its roots in the Bell Labs tradition, influenced significantly by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. Go is described as capturing the "good parts of C" and is sometimes referred to as "C for the 21st century." It offers interesting data structuring capabilities and a straightforward model of concurrency, particularly through Go routines which make parallel computation easier to implement. The speaker acknowledges not being a Go expert despite co-authoring a book on the subject. He notes that while the creators of early UNIX systems probably didn't foresee the shift towards massively parallel computation, today's more multi-core processors necessitate a robust concurrent programming model like that offered by Go.

### Learning New Programming Languages (1:04:57 - 1:08:16)
The speaker shares thoughts on learning different programming languages. He mentions conducting an annual exercise for a programming class, where he writes a small example in as many languages as possible, totaling around 20 languages. This exercise helps evaluate ease of use, performance, and user experience of each language. He finds Lua and Scala very easy to pick up, while Haskell and Rust present more challenges due to unfamiliar constructs and evolving ecosystems. The difficulty of learning new languages often depends on having a worthwhile project that justifies the time investment for mastering them.

### JavaScript (1:04:57 - 1:06:32)
JavaScript is discussed as a language that has evolved significantly since its inception. Initially considered unattractive and unsuitable for academic work, it has become powerful and efficient enough to be used extensively both on front-end and back-end applications. The language's evolving nature and improved compiling technology make it more viable, although the speaker is skeptical that it will take over all domains completely.

### Variety of Programming Languages (1:08:16 - 1:10:30)
The speaker touches upon the plethora of programming languages available today, mentioning that a dozen languages likely cover 95% of programming needs. New languages are seen positively, as they provide a ground to explore new ideas that eventually get integrated into mainstream languages. Functional programming languages, in particular, have been instrumental in introducing advanced concepts like recursion, pattern matching, and lambdas, which are now common in other languages.

### AMPL (1:10:30 - 1:18:01)
The AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) system is discussed, highlighting its role in optimization problems like linear programming. The speaker was part of the original development team and contributed to its early implementation. AMPL allows users to define mathematical optimization models in a readable format, separate from the data on which they operate. This separation enables using different solvers for various optimization issues, such as linear and nonlinear programming. Despite not being much involved since its initial development, the speaker appreciates the language's elegance and utility in abstracting complex optimization problems in a human-readable form.

### Graph Theory (1:18:01 - 1:22:20)
The conversation moves to the topic of graph theory, specifically the P vs. NP problem. The speaker leans towards the popular belief that P does not equal NP, acknowledging that his own intuition is less developed than his colleagues’ in this field. He shares his early work on graph partitioning during his PhD, which predated the formal development of computational complexity theory. Heuristic methods were used for problem-solving back then, focusing more on practical applications rather than theoretical computational classes.

### AI in 1964 (1:22:20 - end)
The speaker briefly touches upon artificial intelligence in 1964, noting that the landscape was nascent and filled with high hopes and speculative ideas. This was before the AI winters when enthusiasm far outpaced the practical realities and technological limitations of the time.
