The history of text editors is briefly touched upon, illustrating the evolution from line-based editors to more advanced, cursor-based systems. The speaker’s affinity lies in using tools that provide efficiency and speed without the necessity of opening extensive software environments.

### 46:39 - History of programming languages

A concise history of programming languages is provided, tracing their development from the late 1940s. Initially, programming involved machine code (zeros and ones) directly entered via switches or punched paper tapes. This evolved into assembly languages, where mnemonics represented machine instructions, making programming somewhat easier. In the late 1950s, higher-level languages like Fortran, COBOL, and Algol emerged, making programming accessible to more people and abstracting away machine details. The 1970s saw the rise of system programming languages such as C, which balanced low-level control with high-level expressiveness, fostering portability and broader adoption. This historical progression highlights a trend towards increasing abstraction and ease of use.

### 52:48 - C programming language

The discussion delves into why the C programming language has endured and had such a profound impact. C is praised for its balance of expressiveness and efficiency, which was crucial when computing resources were limited. It also benefited from its association with Unix, making both the language and the operating system portable across different machines. This portability and the positive feedback loop between Unix and C helped cement its place in programming history. The C programming language's enduring popularity is attributed to hitting a 'sweet spot' in terms of its utility and performance, combined with robust supporting environments like Unix.

### Go Language (58:44 - 1:01:57)
The discussion shifts to the Go programming language, which the speaker had co-authored a book about. The language has its roots in the Bell Labs tradition, influenced significantly by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. Go is described as capturing the "good parts of C" and is sometimes referred to as "C for the 21st century." It offers interesting data structuring capabilities and a straightforward model of concurrency, particularly through Go routines which make parallel computation easier to implement. The speaker acknowledges not being a Go expert despite co-authoring a book on the subject. He notes that while the creators of early UNIX systems probably didn't foresee the shift towards massively parallel computation, today's more multi-core processors necessitate a robust concurrent programming model like that offered by Go.

### Learning New Programming Languages (1:04:57 - 1:08:16)
The speaker shares thoughts on learning different programming languages. He mentions conducting an annual exercise for a programming class, where he writes a small example in as many languages as possible, totaling around 20 languages. This exercise helps evaluate ease of use, performance, and user experience of each language. He finds Lua and Scala very easy to pick up, while Haskell and Rust present more challenges due to unfamiliar constructs and evolving ecosystems. The difficulty of learning new languages often depends on having a worthwhile project that justifies the time investment for mastering them.

### JavaScript (1:04:57 - 1:06:32)
JavaScript is discussed as a language that has evolved significantly since its inception. Initially considered unattractive and unsuitable for academic work, it has become powerful and efficient enough to be used extensively both on front-end and back-end applications. The language's evolving nature and improved compiling technology make it more viable, although the speaker is skeptical that it will take over all domains completely.

### Variety of Programming Languages (1:08:16 - 1:10:30)
The speaker touches upon the plethora of programming languages available today, mentioning that a dozen languages likely cover 95% of programming needs. New languages are seen positively, as they provide a ground to explore new ideas that eventually get integrated into mainstream languages. Functional programming languages, in particular, have been instrumental in introducing advanced concepts like recursion, pattern matching, and lambdas, which are now common in other languages.

### AMPL (1:10:30 - 1:18:01)
The AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) system is discussed, highlighting its role in optimization problems like linear programming. The speaker was part of the original development team and contributed to its early implementation.
