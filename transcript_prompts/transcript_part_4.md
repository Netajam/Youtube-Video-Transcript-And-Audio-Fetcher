[01:25:04] maybe every hour if you have to, [01:25:07] there's a real return on investment there. [01:25:09] But there needs to be a
critical mass of this task. [01:25:13] And we're focusing on a few
that we believe are ubiquitous [01:25:19] in the industrial production environment. [01:25:22] And that's using a thermal
camera to keep things [01:25:25] from overheating, using an acoustic imager [01:25:28] to find compressed air
leaks, using visual cameras [01:25:32] to read gauges, measuring vibration. [01:25:35] These are standard things that you do [01:25:38] to prevent unintended
shutdown of a factory. [01:25:41] And this takes place in a beer factory. [01:25:45] We're working with AB InBev. [01:25:47] It takes place in chip fabs. [01:25:49] You know, we're working
with GlobalFoundries. [01:25:51] It takes place in electric utilities [01:25:54] and nuclear power plants. [01:25:55] And so, the same robot can be applied [01:25:58] in all of these industries. [01:26:02] And as I said, we have [01:26:03] about, actually it's 1,100 Spots out now. [01:26:06] To really get, you know,
profitability, we need to be [01:26:09] at 1,000 a year, maybe
1,500 a year, you know, [01:26:12] for that sort of part of the business. [01:26:15] So, it still needs to grow,
but we're on a good path. [01:26:19] So, I think that's totally achievable. [01:26:21] - So, the application
should require crossing [01:26:24] that 1,000-robot barrier. [01:26:25] - It really should, yeah. [01:26:27] I wanna mention, you know,
our second robot, Stretch. [01:26:30] - Yeah, tell me about Stretch. [01:26:32] What's Stretch? [01:26:32] Who is Stretch? [01:26:33] - Stretch started differently than Spot. [01:26:36] You know, Spot we built
because we had decades [01:26:39] of experience building quadrupeds. [01:26:41] We had it in our blood. [01:26:42] We had to build a quadruped product, [01:26:44] but we had to go figure out
what the application was, [01:26:47] and we actually discovered this
factory-patrol application, [01:26:52] basically preventative maintenance [01:26:54] by seeing what our customers did with it. [01:26:57] Stretch was very different. [01:26:58] We started knowing [01:27:00] that there was warehouses
all over the world. [01:27:02] There's shipping containers
moving all around the world full [01:27:06] of boxes that are mostly
being moved by hand. [01:27:10] By some estimates, we think
there's a trillion boxes, [01:27:13] (laughs) cardboard boxes shipped
around the world each year. [01:27:16] And a lot of it's done manually. [01:27:18] It became clear early on
that there was an opportunity [01:27:22] for a mobile robot in
here to move boxes around. [01:27:24] And the commercial experience
has been very different [01:27:27] between Stretch and with Spot. [01:27:30] As soon as we started talking
to people, potential customers [01:27:35] about what Stretch was gonna be used for, [01:27:37] they immediately started saying, [01:27:38] "Oh, I'll buy that robot. [01:27:40] You know, in fact, I'm
gonna put in an order [01:27:42] for 20 right now." [01:27:43] We just started shipping
the robot in January [01:27:47] after, you know, several
years of development. [01:27:49] - [Lex] Of this year? [01:27:49] - Of this year. [01:27:50] So, our first deliveries of
Stretch to customers were [01:27:53] DHL and Maersk in January. [01:27:55] We're delivering to Gap
right now, and we have [01:27:59] about seven or eight other customers, [01:28:01] all who've already
agreed in advance to buy [01:28:03] between 10 and 20 robots, [01:28:05] and so we've already got commitments [01:28:06] for, you know, a couple
hundred of these robots. [01:28:10] This one's gonna go, right? [01:28:11] It's so obvious that there's a need, [01:28:14] and we're not just gonna unload trucks. [01:28:15] We're gonna do any box-moving
task in the warehouse. [01:28:18] And so, it too will be
a multipurpose robot, [01:28:21] and we'll eventually have
it doing palletizing, [01:28:23] or depalletizing, or loading
trucks, or unloading trucks. [01:28:28] There's definitely thousands of robots. [01:28:30] There's probably tens
of thousands of robots [01:28:32] of this in the future, so
it's gonna be profitable. [01:28:35] - Can you describe what
Stretch looks like? [01:28:37] - It looks like a big, strong
robot arm on a mobile base. [01:28:42] The base is about the size of a pallet, [01:28:44] and we wanted it to be
the size of a pallet [01:28:46] because that's what lives
in warehouses, right, [01:28:48] pallets of goods sitting everywhere, [01:28:50] so it needed to be able
to fit in that space. [01:28:52] - [Lex] It's not a legged robot. [01:28:53] - It's not a legged robot. [01:28:54] So, it was our first, [01:28:57] it was actually a bit [01:29:00] of a commitment from us, [01:29:03] a challenge for us to build
a non-balancing robot. [01:29:06] (Lex laughs) [01:29:07] - To do the much easier
problem but to do it well. [01:29:10] - Well, because, you know, [01:29:12] it wasn't gonna have this balance problem. [01:29:14] And in fact, the very first version [01:29:16] of the logistics robot we
built was a balancing robot, [01:29:20] and that's called Handle. [01:29:22] And there's-
- That thing was epic. [01:29:24] - Oh, it's a beautiful machine. [01:29:25] - It's an incredible machine. [01:29:28] (Robert laughs) [01:29:29] (Lex laughs) [01:29:30] I mean, it looks epic. [01:29:31] It looks like, I mean, [01:29:35] out of a sci-fi movie of some sorts. [01:29:36] I mean, can you actually just linger [01:29:38] on, like, the design of that thing? [01:29:40] 'Cause that's another leap [01:29:41] into something you probably haven't done. [01:29:43] It's a different kind of balancing. [01:29:44] - Yeah, so let me-
- It's wild. [01:29:45] - I love talking about the
history of how Handle came about [01:29:48] (Lex laughs) [01:29:49] because it connects all
of our robots, actually. [01:29:52] So, I'm gonna start with Atlas. [01:29:56] When we had Atlas
getting fairly far along, [01:29:59] we wanted to understand,
I was telling you earlier, [01:30:01] the challenge of the human form is [01:30:03] that you have this mass up high,
and balancing that inertia, [01:30:09] that mass up high is its
own unique challenge. [01:30:12] And so, we started trying to get Atlas [01:30:14] to balance standing on one foot, [01:30:16] like on a balance beam
using its arms like this, [01:30:20] and you know, you can do this, I'm sure. [01:30:21] I can do this, right? [01:30:22] Like, if you're walking a tightrope, [01:30:24] how do you do that balance? [01:30:26] So, that's sort of, you know,
controlling the inertia, [01:30:29] controlling the momentum of the robot. [01:30:32] We were starting to
figure that out on Atlas. [01:30:35] And so, our first concept of Handle, [01:30:37] which was a robot that was
gonna be on two wheels, [01:30:40] so it had to balance, but it
was gonna have a big, long arm [01:30:43] so it could reach a box
at the top of a truck, [01:30:47] and it needed yet another
counterbalance, a big tail, [01:30:52] to help it balance while
it was using its arm. [01:30:56] So, the reason why this
robot sort of looks epic, [01:31:01] some people said it looked like an ostrich [01:31:04] or maybe, you know, an
ostrich moving around, was [01:31:08] the wheels, the leg. [01:31:09] It has legs, so it can extend its legs. [01:31:12] So, it's wheels on legs. [01:31:13] We always wanted to build wheels on legs. [01:31:15] It had a tail, and it had this arm, [01:31:17] and they're all moving
simultaneously and in coordination [01:31:20] to maintain balance because we had figured [01:31:22] out the mathematics of
doing this momentum control, [01:31:25] how to maintain that balance. [01:31:28] And so, part of the reason [01:31:29] why we built this two-legged robot was [01:31:31] we had figured this thing out. [01:31:33] We wanted to see it in
this kind of machine, [01:31:36] and we thought maybe this
kind of machine would be good [01:31:38] in a warehouse, and so we built it. [01:31:39] And it's a beautiful machine. [01:31:41] It moves in a graceful way
like nothing else we've built. [01:31:45] But it wasn't the right machine
for a logistics application. [01:31:48] We decided it was too slow [01:31:50] and couldn't pick boxes
fast enough, basically. [01:31:53] - Oh.
- And it- [01:31:54] - Do it beautifully [01:31:55] with elegance.
- It did beautifully, [01:31:56] but it just wasn't efficient enough. [01:31:58] - [Lex] Aw. [01:31:59] - So, we let it go. [01:32:00] - [Lex] Yeah. [01:32:00] - But I think we'll come back
to that machine eventually. [01:32:04] - The fact that it's possible,
the fact that you showed [01:32:06] that you could do so many
things at the same time [01:32:09] in coordination and so beautifully,
there's something there. [01:32:12] - [Robert] Yeah. [01:32:13] - That was a demonstration
of what is possible. [01:32:15] - Basically, we made a hard decision, [01:32:17] and this was really kind of a
hard-nosed business decision. [01:32:21] It indicated us not doing
it just for the beauty [01:32:25] of the mathematics or the curiosity, [01:32:27] but no, we actually
need to build a business [01:32:29] that can make money in the long run. [01:32:32] And so, we ended up building Stretch, [01:32:34] which has a big, heavy base
with a giant battery in the base [01:32:37] of it that allows it
to run for two shifts, [01:32:41] 16 hours worth of operation. [01:32:43] And that big battery sort of
helps it stay balanced, right? [01:32:47] So, it can move a 50-pound
box around with its arm [01:32:50] and not tip over it. [01:32:52] It's omnidirectional, [01:32:53] it can move in any direction,
and it has a nice suspension [01:32:57] built into it so it can
deal with, you know, gaps [01:33:00] or things on the floor and roll over it. [01:33:03] But it's not a balancing robot. [01:33:05] It's a mobile robot arm that
can work to carry, or pick, [01:33:09] or place a box up to 50 pounds
anywhere in the warehouse. [01:33:13] - Take a box from point
A to point B anywhere. [01:33:16] - Yeah, palletize, depalletize. [01:33:19] We're starting with unloading trucks [01:33:21] because there's so many
trucks and containers [01:33:23] where goods are shipped,
and it's a brutal job. [01:33:26] You know, in the summer,
it can be 120 degrees [01:33:28] inside that container. [01:33:29] People don't wanna do that job, [01:33:33] and it's backbreaking labor, right? [01:33:34] Again, these can be up to 50-pound boxes. [01:33:38] And so, we feel like this
is a productivity enhancer, [01:33:43] and for the people who used to
do that job unloading trucks, [01:33:46] they're actually operating the robot now. [01:33:49] And so, by building robots
that are easy to control, [01:33:53] and it doesn't take an
advanced degree to manage, [01:33:56] you can become a robot operator. [01:33:57] And so, as we've introduced these robots [01:34:00] to both DHL, and Maersk, and
Gap, the warehouse workers [01:34:03] who were doing that manual labor are [01:34:05] now the robot operators,
and so we see this [01:34:07] as ultimately a benefit to them as well. [01:34:11] - Can you say how much Stretch costs? [01:34:16] - Not yet, but I will
say that, when we engage [01:34:21] with our customers, they'll
be able to see a return [01:34:24] on investment in typically two years. [01:34:26] - Okay, so that's something
that you're constantly thinking [01:34:28] about, how- [01:34:29] - [Robert] Yeah. [01:34:30] - And I suppose you
have to do the same kind [01:34:31] of thinking with Spot. [01:34:32] So-
- Yes. [01:34:33] - it seems like with
Stretch the application is, [01:34:36] like, directly obvious. [01:34:38] - [Robert] Yeah, it's a slam dunk. [01:34:39] - Yeah, and so you have a
little more flexibility. [01:34:42] - Well, I think we know the target. [01:34:44] We know what we're going after. [01:34:45] - [Lex] Yeah. [01:34:46] - And with Spot, it took
us a while to figure [01:34:47] out what we were going after. [01:34:49] - Well, let me return to that question [01:34:50] about maybe the
conversation you were having [01:34:55] a while ago with Larry Page, maybe looking [01:34:58] to the longer future of
social robotics, of using Spot [01:35:04] to connect with human
beings perhaps in the home. [01:35:06] Do you see a future there [01:35:08] if we were to sort of hypothesize
or dream about a future [01:35:12] where Spot-like robots
are in the home as pets, [01:35:15] a social robot?
- We definitely think [01:35:16] about it, and we would like to get there. [01:35:20] We think the pathway to
getting there is, you know, [01:35:23] likely through these
industrial applications [01:35:26] and then mass manufacturing, you know. [01:35:28] Let's figure out how to build the robots, [01:35:31] how to make the software
so that they can really do [01:35:33] a broad set of skills. [01:35:35] That's going to take real
investment to get there. [01:35:39] Performance first, right? [01:35:41] A principle of the company has always been [01:35:43] really make the robots do useful stuff. [01:35:45] And so, you know, the
social robot companies [01:35:50] that try to start someplace else [01:35:52] by just making a cute interaction, [01:35:54] mostly they haven't survived. [01:35:56] And so, we think the utility
really needs to come first, [01:36:01] and that means you have to solve some [01:36:04] of these hard problems. [01:36:05] And so, to get there, we're
gonna go through the design [01:36:10] and software development in industrial, [01:36:13] and then that's eventually
gonna let you reach a scale [01:36:15] that could then be
addressed to a commercial, [01:36:18] a consumer-level market, and
so, yeah, maybe we'll be able [01:36:22] to build a smaller Spot with an arm [01:36:24] that could really go
get your beer for you. [01:36:26] - Mm-hmm. [01:36:27] - But there's things we
need to figure out still, [01:36:30] how to safely, really safely, [01:36:32] and if you're gonna be
interacting with children, [01:36:35] you better be safe. (laughs) [01:36:37] And right now, we count on a little bit [01:36:40] of standoff distance
between the robot and people [01:36:42] so that you don't pinch a
finger, you know, in the robot. [01:36:45] So, you've got a lot of
things you need to go solve [01:36:47] before you jump to that
consumer-level product. [01:36:50] - Well, there's a kind
of trade off in safety [01:36:52] because it feels like, in
the home, you can fall. [01:36:58] Like, you don't have to be as good. [01:37:02] Like, you're allowed to
fail in different ways, [01:37:05] in more ways as long as
it's safe for the humans. [01:37:09] So, it just feels like an
easier problem to solve [01:37:12] 'cause it feels like, in the factory, [01:37:13] you're not allowed to fail. [01:37:16] - That may be true, but
I also think the variety [01:37:19] of things a consumer-level
robot would be expected [01:37:23] to do will also be quite broad. [01:37:25] - [Lex] Yeah. [01:37:26] - And they're gonna want to get the beer [01:37:27] and know the difference between
the beer and a Coca-Cola [01:37:30] or my snack. [01:37:33] You know, they're all gonna
want you to clean up the dishes, [01:37:37] you know, from the table
without breaking 'em. (laughs) [01:37:40] Those are pretty complex tasks, [01:37:42] and so there's still
work to be done there. [01:37:45] - So, to push back on that,
here's what application [01:37:47] I think that'll be very interesting. [01:37:49] I think the application
of being a pet, a friend, [01:37:53] so, like, no tasks. [01:37:56] Just be cute, not cute, not cute. [01:38:01] A dog is more than just cute. [01:38:02] A dog is a friend, is a companion. [01:38:04] There's something about just
having interacted with them. [01:38:07] And maybe 'cause I'm hanging out alone [01:38:09] with robot dogs a little too much, [01:38:12] but, like, there's a connection there. [01:38:15] And it feels like that connection
should not be disregarded. [01:38:20] You-
- No. [01:38:21] It should not be disregarded. [01:38:23] Robots that can somehow communicate [01:38:25] through their physical gestures [01:38:26] you're gonna be more
attached to in the long run. [01:38:30] Do you remember Aibo-
- Mm-hmm. [01:38:32] - the Sony Aibo? [01:38:33] - Yep.
- They sold [01:38:34] over 100,000 of those, maybe 150,000, [01:38:38] you know, what probably wasn't considered [01:38:39] a successful product for them. [01:38:42] They suspended that eventually, [01:38:44] and then they brought it back. [01:38:45] Sony brought it back, [01:38:46] and people definitely,
you know, treated this [01:38:49] as a pet, as a companion. [01:38:53] And I think that will come around again. [01:38:57] Will you get away without
having any other utility? [01:39:01] Maybe in a world where we can really talk [01:39:03] to our simple little pet
because, you know, ChatGPT [01:39:07] or some other generative
AI has made it possible [01:39:10] for you to really talk in what
seems like a meaningful way. [01:39:14] Maybe that'll open the
social robot up again. [01:39:21] That's probably not a
path we're gonna go down [01:39:23] because, again, we're so focused
on performance and utility. [01:39:28] We can add those other things also, [01:39:30] but we really wanna start [01:39:32] from that foundation of utility, I think. [01:39:34] - Yeah. [01:39:35] But I also wanna predict
that you're wrong on that, [01:39:39] which is that the very path you're taking, [01:39:42] which is creating a great robot platform, [01:39:44] will very easily take a leap to adding [01:39:49] a ChatGPT-like capability, maybe GPT 5. [01:39:53] And there's just so many
open-source alternatives [01:39:55] that you could just plop
down on top of Spot. [01:39:58] And because you have this robust platform, [01:40:01] and you're figuring out
how to mass-manufacture it, [01:40:03] and how to drive the cost down, [01:40:05] and how to make it, you know, reliable, [01:40:06] all those kinds of things,
it'll be the natural transition [01:40:09] to where just adding ChatGPT [01:40:11] on top of it could-
- Oh, I do think [01:40:13] that being able to verbally converse [01:40:17] or even converse through gestures, [01:40:20] you know, part of these learning models is [01:40:23] that, you know, you can now
look at video and imagery [01:40:25] and associate, you know, intent with that. [01:40:30] Those will all help in the communication [01:40:33] between robots and people, for sure. [01:40:35] And that's gonna happen
obviously more quickly [01:40:37] than any of us were expecting. (laughs) [01:40:39] - I mean, what else do you want from life? [01:40:42] A friend to get you a beer
(Robert laughs) [01:40:44] and then just talk shit
about the state of the world. [01:40:48] (Robert laughs) [01:40:50] I mean, there's a deep
loneliness within all of us. [01:40:52] And I think a beer and a good
chat solves so much of it [01:40:57] or takes us a long way to solving [01:41:00] a lot of it.
- It'll be interesting [01:41:01] to see, you know, [01:41:06] when a generative AI can give you [01:41:09] that warm feeling that
you connected, you know, [01:41:13] and that, "Oh, yeah, you remember me. [01:41:15] You're my friend. [01:41:16] You know, we have a history." [01:41:18] You know, that history matters, right? [01:41:20] - [Lex] Memory of joint, like- [01:41:21] - Memory of, yeah. (laughs) [01:41:23] - Having witnessed,
that's what friendship, [01:41:25] that's what connection,
that's what love is. [01:41:28] In many cases, some of the
deepest friendships you have is [01:41:31] having gone through a
difficult time together- [01:41:33] - Mm-hmm.
- and having a shared memory [01:41:35] of an amazing time or a difficult time [01:41:38] and kind of that memory
creating this, like, foundation [01:41:43] based on which you can then
experience the world together. [01:41:46] The silly, the mundane stuff
of day to day is somehow built [01:41:49] on a foundation of having gone [01:41:51] through some shit in the past. [01:41:52] And the current systems are
not personalized in that way [01:41:56] but-
- Right. [01:41:57] - I think that's a technical problem, [01:41:58] not some kind of fundamental limitation, [01:42:01] so combine that with an
embodied robot like Spot, [01:42:04] which already has magic in its movement, [01:42:08] I think it's a very
interesting possibility [01:42:11] of where that takes us. [01:42:13] But of course, you have to
build that on top of a company [01:42:16] that's making money
with real applications, [01:42:19] with real customers, and
with robots that are safe, [01:42:22] and work, and reliable,
and manufactured at scale. [01:42:27] - And I think we're in a
unique position in that [01:42:31] because of, you know, our
investors, primarily Hyundai, [01:42:34] but also SoftBank still owns 20% of us. [01:42:39] They're not totally fixated
on driving us to profitability [01:42:44] as soon as possible. [01:42:45] That's not the goal. [01:42:46] The goal really is a
longer-term vision of creating, [01:42:51] you know, what does
mobility mean in the future? [01:42:54] How is this mobile robot
technology going to influence us, [01:42:59] and can we shape that? [01:43:00] And they want both. [01:43:02] And so, we as a company are
trying to strike that balance [01:43:05] between, "Let's build a
business that makes money." [01:43:09] I've been describing that [01:43:10] to my own team as self-destination. [01:43:14] If I wanna drive my own ship,
we need to have a business [01:43:16] that's profitable in the end. [01:43:18] Otherwise, somebody else is
gonna drive the ship for us. [01:43:21] So, that's really important. [01:43:23] But we're gonna retain the
aspiration that we're gonna build [01:43:28] the next generation of
technology at the same time. [01:43:31] And the real trick will
be if we can do both. [01:43:35] - Speaking of ships, let me
ask you about a competitor [01:43:39] and somebody who's become a friend. [01:43:41] So, Elon Musk and Tesla
have announced they've been [01:43:45] in the early days of
building a humanoid robot. [01:43:48] How does that change the
landscape of your work? [01:43:55] So, from an outside
perspective, it seems like, [01:43:59] well, as a fan of robotics,
it just seems exciting. [01:44:03] - Right, very exciting, right? [01:44:04] When Elon speaks, people listen. [01:44:08] And so, it suddenly brought
a bright light onto the work [01:44:12] that we'd been doing, you
know, for over a decade. [01:44:16] And I think that's only gonna help. [01:44:19] And in fact, what we've seen
is that, in addition to Tesla, [01:44:24] we're seeing a proliferation
of robotic companies arise now. [01:44:30] - Including humanoid? [01:44:31] - [Robert] Yes. [01:44:31] - Oh, wow.
- Yeah. [01:44:32] And interestingly, many of them [01:44:36] as they're, you know,
raising money, for example, [01:44:39] will claim whether or not they have [01:44:41] a former Boston Dynamics employee [01:44:43] on their staff as a criteria. [01:44:44] (both laughing) [01:44:46] - Yeah, that's true. [01:44:49] I would do that as a
company, yeah, for sure. [01:44:51] - Yeah, so-
- Shows you're legit, yeah. [01:44:53] - Yeah, so, you know,
(Lex laughs) [01:44:56] it has brung a tremendous validation [01:44:58] to what we're doing and excitement. [01:45:02] Competitive juices are flowing,
you know, the whole thing. [01:45:04] So, it's all good. [01:45:07] - Elon has also kind of stated [01:45:13] that, you know, [01:45:18] maybe he implied that
the problem is solvable [01:45:22] in the near term, which is
a low-cost humanoid robot [01:45:28] that's a relatively
general use case robot. [01:45:32] So, I think Elon is known for
sort of setting these kinds [01:45:37] of incredibly ambitious
goals, maybe missing deadlines [01:45:42] but actually pushing not just
the particular team he leads [01:45:45] but the entire world to,
like, accomplishing those. [01:45:52] Do you see Boston Dynamics in
the near future being pushed [01:45:54] in that kind of way, like
this excitement of competition [01:45:57] kinda pushing Atlas maybe
to do more cool stuff, [01:46:03] trying to drive the cost
of Atlas down perhaps? [01:46:08] I mean, I guess I wanna
ask if there's some kind [01:46:12] of exciting energy in Boston Dynamics [01:46:17] due to this little bit of competition. [01:46:19] - Oh, yeah, definitely. [01:46:22] When we released our most
recent video of Atlas, you know, [01:46:26] I think you had seen it, the scaffolding [01:46:28] and throwing the box of tools around [01:46:30] and then doing the flip at the end, [01:46:32] we were trying to show the world [01:46:34] that not only can we do
this parkour mobility thing, [01:46:38] but we can pick up and move heavy things [01:46:41] because, if you're gonna work [01:46:43] in a manufacturing environment, [01:46:45] that's what you gotta be able to do. [01:46:47] And for the reasons I
explained to you earlier, [01:46:51] it's not trivial to do so, you know, [01:46:53] changing the center of mass, you know, [01:46:56] by picking up a 50-pound block, you know, [01:46:58] for a robot that weighs 150 pounds, [01:47:02] that's a lot to accommodate. [01:47:04] So, we're trying to show
that we can do that, [01:47:09] so it's totally been energizing. [01:47:11] You know, we see the
next phase of Atlas being [01:47:16] more dextrous hands that can
manipulate and grab more things [01:47:19] that we're gonna start by
moving big things around [01:47:23] that are heavy and that affect balance. [01:47:25] And why is that? [01:47:26] Well, really tiny dextrous
things probably are gonna be hard [01:47:30] for a while yet, you know. [01:47:32] Maybe you could go build a
special-purpose robot arm, [01:47:36] you know, for stuffing, you know, chips [01:47:39] into electronics boards,
but we don't really wanna [01:47:42] really fine work like that. [01:47:45] I think more course work
where you're using two hands [01:47:48] to pick up and balance an unwieldy thing [01:47:50] maybe in a manufacturing environment, [01:47:52] maybe in a construction environment, [01:47:54] those are the things that we
think robots are gonna be able [01:47:57] to do with the level of
dexterity that they're gonna have [01:48:00] in the next few years, and
that's where we're headed. [01:48:05] And you know, Elon has
seen the same thing, right? [01:48:07] He's talking about using the robots [01:48:08] in a manufacturing environment. [01:48:11] We think there's something
very interesting there [01:48:12] about having a two-armed robot [01:48:16] because, when you have two
arms, you can transfer a thing [01:48:19] from one hand to the other. [01:48:20] You can turn it around. [01:48:21] You know, you can reorient it
in a way that you can't do it [01:48:24] if you just have one hand
on it, and so there's a lot [01:48:27] that extra arm brings to the table. [01:48:29] - So, I think in terms of mission, [01:48:32] you mentioned Boston
Dynamics really wants to see [01:48:35] what's the limits of what's possible. [01:48:38] And so, the cost comes
second, or it's a component, [01:48:42] but first figure out
what are the limitations. [01:48:44] I think, with Elon, he's
really driving the cost down. [01:48:47] Is there some inspiration,
some lessons you see there [01:48:52] of the challenge of driving the cost down, [01:48:55] especially with Atlas
with a humanoid robot? [01:48:56] - Well, I think the thing that
he's certainly been learning [01:48:59] by building car factories is [01:49:02] what that looks like in scaling. [01:49:06] By scaling, you can get
efficiencies that drive costs down- [01:49:10] - Sure.
- very well. [01:49:13] And the smart thing
that, you know, they have [01:49:15] in their favor is, you know,
they know how to manufacture. [01:49:19] They know how to build electric motors. [01:49:20] They know how to build, you know, [01:49:22] computers and vision systems,
so there's a lot of overlap [01:49:25] between modern automotive
companies and robots. [01:49:31] But hey, we have a modern robotic, I mean, [01:49:36] automotive company behind us as well. [01:49:38] (Lex laughs) [01:49:40] - So, bring it on. [01:49:41] - Who's doing pretty well, right? [01:49:42] The electric vehicles from
Hyundai are doing pretty well. [01:49:46] - I love it. [01:49:47] So, we've talked about some
of the low-level control, [01:49:52] some of the incredible
stuff that's going on [01:49:55] and basic perception, but
how much do you see currently [01:49:59] and in the future of
Boston Dynamics's sort [01:50:02] of higher-level machine
learning applications? [01:50:06] Do you see customers adding
on those capabilities, [01:50:09] or do you see Boston
Dynamics doing that in house? [01:50:12] - Some kinds of things [01:50:13] we really believe are probably gonna be [01:50:17] more broadly available,
maybe even commoditized, [01:50:21] you know, using a machine learning, [01:50:23] like a vision algorithm [01:50:24] so a robot can recognize
something in the environment. [01:50:27] That ought to be something
you can just download. [01:50:29] Like, I'm going to a new
environment, and I have a new kind [01:50:32] of door handle or piece of
equipment I wanna inspect. [01:50:34] You ought to be able
to just download that. [01:50:36] And I think people [01:50:37] besides Boston Dynamics will provide that. [01:50:39] And we've actually built
an API that lets people add [01:50:43] these vision algorithms to Spot, [01:50:48] and we're currently
working with some partners [01:50:49] who are providing that. [01:50:51] Levatas is a example of a small provider [01:50:54] who's giving us software
for reading gauges, [01:50:58] and actually, another partner [01:50:59] in Europe, Reply, is doing the same thing. [01:51:02] So, we see ultimately an ecosystem [01:51:07] of providers doing stuff like that. [01:51:10] I think ultimately you might even be able [01:51:13] to do the same thing with behaviors. [01:51:15] So, this technology will
also be brought to bear [01:51:19] on controlling the robot,
the motions of the robot. [01:51:24] And you know, we're using
learning, reinforcement learning [01:51:27] to develop algorithms for both
locomotion and manipulation. [01:51:33] And ultimately, this is gonna mean [01:51:35] you can add new behaviors to
a robot, you know, quickly. [01:51:39] And that could potentially be done [01:51:42] outside of Boston Dynamics. [01:51:43] Right now, that's all internal to us. [01:51:46] I think you need to understand
at a deep level, you know, [01:51:51] the robot control to do that. [01:51:53] But eventually, that could be outside. [01:51:55] But it's certainly a place [01:51:56] where these approaches
are gonna be brought [01:51:58] to bear in robotics. [01:52:00] - So, reinforcement learning
is part of the process. [01:52:03] So, you do use reinforcement learning. [01:52:05] - [Robert] Yes. [01:52:07] (Lex sighs) [01:52:08] So, there's increasing levels
of learning with these robots? [01:52:11] - [Robert] Yes. [01:52:12] - And that's for locomotion,
for manipulation, [01:52:16] for perception? [01:52:17] - [Robert] Yes. [01:52:19] - Well, what do you think in general [01:52:21] about all the exciting advancements [01:52:23] of transformer neural networks, [01:52:28] most beautifully illustrated [01:52:32] through the large language
models like GPT 4? [01:52:37] - Like everybody else,
we're all, you know, [01:52:40] I'm surprised at how far they've come. [01:52:47] I'm a little bit nervous about the, [01:52:51] there's anxiety around them, obviously, [01:52:54] for, I think, good reasons, right? [01:52:58] Disinformation is a curse,
an unintended consequence [01:53:03] of social media that could be
exacerbated with these tools. [01:53:08] So, if you use them to
deploy disinformation, [01:53:11] it could be a real risk. [01:53:15] But I also think that the risks
associated with these kinds [01:53:18] of models don't have a whole lot to do [01:53:21] with the way we're gonna
use them in our robots. [01:53:24] If I'm using a robot, I'm
building a robot to do, you know, [01:53:27] a manual task of some sort. [01:53:31] I can judge very easily, is it
doing the task I asked it to? [01:53:35] Is it doing it correctly? [01:53:37] There's sort of a built-in
mechanism for judging. [01:53:41] Is it doing the right thing? [01:53:43] Did it successfully do the task? [01:53:45] - Yeah, physical reality
is a good verifier. [01:53:47] - It's a good verifier. [01:53:48] That's exactly it, and
whereas if you're asking [01:53:51] for, yeah, I don't know,
