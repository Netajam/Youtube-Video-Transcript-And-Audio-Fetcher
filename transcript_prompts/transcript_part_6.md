[02:24:39] - And I think a lotta that has
to do with the interaction, [02:24:42] the collaboration with
robots and with AI systems. [02:24:45] I'm hoping there's a lot of
interesting possibilities there. [02:24:47] - I think that could
be really cool, right? [02:24:50] If you can work in an interaction
and really be helpful, [02:24:54] robots, you know, you can
ask a robot to do a job [02:24:58] you wouldn't ask a person to do, [02:25:00] and that would be a real asset. [02:25:01] You wouldn't feel guilty
about it, you know. (laughs) [02:25:04] You'd say, "Just do it." [02:25:05] - Yeah.
- It's a machine. [02:25:06] And I don't have to have
qualms about that, you know. [02:25:09] - The ones that are machines,
I also hope to see a future, [02:25:14] and it is hope. [02:25:15] I do have optimism about the future [02:25:17] where some of the robots are pets, [02:25:19] have an emotional connection to us humans [02:25:22] and because one of the problems
that humans have to solve is [02:25:25] this kind of general loneliness. [02:25:29] The more love you have in your life, [02:25:30] the more friends you have in your life, [02:25:33] I think that makes a more
enriching life, helps you grow. [02:25:36] And I don't fundamentally see why some [02:25:38] of those friends can't be robots. [02:25:39] - There's an interesting
long-running study, [02:25:42] maybe it's in Harvard, just
nice report article written [02:25:46] about it recently. [02:25:47] They've been studying this group [02:25:49] of a few thousand people
now for 70 or 80 years. [02:25:54] And the conclusion is that
companionship and friendship are [02:25:59] the things that make for
a better and happier life. [02:26:03] And so, I agree with you, [02:26:06] and I think that could
happen with a machine [02:26:10] that is probably, you know,
simulating intelligence. [02:26:15] I'm not convinced there will
ever be true intelligence [02:26:18] in these machines, sentience. [02:26:22] But they could simulate it, [02:26:23] and they could collect your history. [02:26:25] You know, I guess it remains to be seen [02:26:27] whether they can establish that real deep, [02:26:29] you know, when you sit with a friend, [02:26:30] and they remember something
about you and bring that up, [02:26:33] and you feel that connection,
it remains to be seen [02:26:36] if a machine's gonna be
able to do that for you. [02:26:39] - Well, I have to say, inklings [02:26:41] of that already started happening for me. [02:26:43] Some of my best friends are robots. [02:26:45] (Robert laughs) [02:26:46] And I have you to thank
for leading the way [02:26:49] in the accessibility, and the
ease of use of such robots, [02:26:53] and the elegance of their movement. [02:26:55] Robert, you're an incredible person. [02:26:56] Boston Dynamics is an incredible company. [02:26:58] I've just been a fan for many, many years [02:27:01] for everything you stand for, [02:27:02] for everything you do in the world. [02:27:03] If you're interested in
great engineering, robotics, [02:27:05] go join them. [02:27:06] Build cool stuff. [02:27:07] I'll forever celebrate
the work you're doing, [02:27:09] and it's just a big honor [02:27:10] that you would sit with me today and talk. [02:27:13] It means a lot, so thank you so much. [02:27:15] Keep doing great work. [02:27:16] - Thank you, Lex. [02:27:17] I'm honored to be here,
and I appreciate it. [02:27:19] It was fun. [02:27:21] - Thanks for listening
to this conversation [02:27:22] with Robert Playter. [02:27:23] To support this podcast, please check [02:27:25] out our sponsors in the description. [02:27:28] And now, let me leave you some words [02:27:29] from Alan Turing in 1950, [02:27:32] defining what is now
termed the Turing test. [02:27:37] "A computer would deserve
to be called intelligent [02:27:40] if it could deceive a human [02:27:42] into believing that it was human." [02:27:45] Thank you for listening and
hope to see you next time.
